# Amplify Fusion Enhanced Market News API

Enhanced contact API created in Amplify Fusion that demonstrates how to leverage the OpenAI API in a finance analysis example. The market news is retrieved from Finnhub.io's API using Fusion's HTTP/S Client Connector and enhanced using the OpenAI API and a prompt that provides the news response. The prompt provides the data and requests insights as illustrated below:

* You can read more about how a similar prompt was engineered as well as the details of the OpenAI API call and response [here](https://gist.github.com/lbrenman/67ee78c716210448cb2605c8f5d6b2b7).
* The Open API Specification used to create the API in Fusion is in this repo in the file `marketnewsinsights.json` [here](https://github.com/lbrenman/AI-Enhanced-SFDC-Contact-Sales-Tool-API-in-Fusion/blob/master/enhancedcontact.json).
* The OpenAI AI POST body (prompt) is below:

    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
